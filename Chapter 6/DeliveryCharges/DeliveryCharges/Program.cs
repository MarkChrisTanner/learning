Write a program called DeliveryCharges for the package delivery service in
Exercise 4. The program should again use an array that holds the 10 zip codes
of areas to which the company makes deliveries. Create a parallel array
containing 10 delivery charges that differ for each zip code. Prompt a user to
enter a zip code and then display either a message indicating the price of
delivery to that zip code or a message indicating that the company does not
deliver to the requested zip code.
